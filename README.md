# Dynamics of Jovian Infrared Auroral Ionosphere and Thermosphere

## Project Description

Giant planet upper atmospheres are probed via indirect measurements of the bright auroral emissions observed in their poles and in-situ measurements of the surrounding space environment. Previous studies have suggested the auroras are driven by currents that result from the relative flow of molecules of ions and neutrals in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. This research project aims to investigate the region in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere where this interaction occurs. The project involves spectroscopy of  infrared emissions from Jupiter’s ionosphere and thermosphere using high-resolution NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope. The observations allow derivation of H3+ and H2 line-of-sight Doppler shift velocity, emission intensity, rotational temperature, and column density. These parameters allow a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics, heating, and energetics of Jupiter's ionosphere and thermosphere, as well as their coupling to the surrounding magnetosphere.
